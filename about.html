        <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in the quiet town of Ballymena, a group of eccentric car enthusiasts decided that
            ordinary car clubs were just too… ordinary. On April 1st, 1998, the first meeting of what would become the
            legendary Wacky Kar Klub (WKK) took place in the back of a local donut shop—because where else do great
            ideas happen?

            The founding members Clive “The Clutch” McTinker, Sally “Sprocket” Spindle, and Boris “Boogie Wheels”
            Wobble—were united by one shared goal: to celebrate cars in the weirdest, wildest, and most whimsical ways
            possible. No rules about horsepower, paint jobs, or even working engines. If it had wheels, a horn, or a
            questionable paint job, it was welcome.

            The Wacky Kar Klub quickly became famous for its annual “Reverse Rally”, where participants had to drive
            their cars backwards through obstacle courses, and the “Horn Symphony”, a musical parade in which every
            vehicle honked to perform synchronized songs. Rumor has it that the town's mayor once declared it an
            official public holiday… but then retracted it after the 27-car conga line blocked the town square for six
            hours.
            
            Today, the Wacky Kar Klub continues to embrace the absurd, reminding everyone that cars are not just for
            transportation—theyre for fun, laughter, and a little controlled chaos.
